I am doing this challenge from Front-end Mentor to build out 8-page planets 
fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible. So i am using Rreact JS to 
accomplish this task .

The user can: 
* View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs

the app is live now on
